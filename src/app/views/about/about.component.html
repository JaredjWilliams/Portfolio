  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I began my software development journey while I was teaching a Preparing Colleges and Careers class at a local high school.
    Part of our curriculum was administering a career interest test to help students identify potential career paths post college or high school .
    I took the test myself and it suggested that I would be a good fit for a career in software development.

  <h2><u>Mungomash Apprenticeship</u></h2>
  <p>
    I started working at Mungomash later that summer as an apprentice. In this role I was able to learn the basics of software development and web development through a series of projects.
  </p>

  <h2><u>Junior Mobile Developer</u></h2>
  <p>
    After my apprenticeship I was hired as a Junior Developer where I worked on a mobile application for a regional airline.
  </p>

  <h2><u>Fasttracked Program</u></h2>
  <p>
    My contract with the regional airline ended and I was offered a position in the Fasttracked program at Cook Systems.
    In this program I was able to refine my skills in software development and web development.
